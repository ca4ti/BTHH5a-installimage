*******************************************************************************
*        Guide for installing LEDE onto a BT Home Hub 5 Type A & clones       *
*******************************************************************************

You need an USB flash drive with at least 512MB free capacity, formatted as
FAT32, exFAT or ext2/3/4, attached to the Hub. The attached flash drive will be
accessible at /tmp/mounts/<directory>.

To install LEDE, the USB flash drive must have a copy of the file:
  lede-17.01.4-lantiq-xrx200-BTHOMEHUBV5A-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin

To restore the stock Firmware, the USB flash drive must have a copy of the
nanddump backup file (hh5a.nanddump) containing the stock Firmware.

LIST OF COMMANDS

  To create a backup of the installed firmware (Take care to not overwrite
  any previously made backup):
      nanddump --file /tmp/mounts/<directory>/hh5a.nanddump /dev/mtd4

  To install LEDE:
      prepare

  To restore stock firmware:
      restore

TO UPGRADE FROM OpenWrt OR LEDE PRIOR TO r2363-0e34459e6b:

  Restore the stock firmware and do a fresh install of LEDE.

If you don't have a backup of the stock firmware from your Hub, use the
experimental 'migrate' script. It is offered with no guarantee of success. 
You are strongly advised to restore the stock firmware.
